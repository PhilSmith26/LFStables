<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>Canadian Labour Force Survey Browser</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> This is a Canadian labour force survey browser. It presents the main results of Statistics Canada's labour force survey (LFS), in both tabular and graphical format. The survey gives a remarkably rich and timely picture of the Canadian labour market from 1976 to date. If you are interested in this topic, you could easily spend hours effortlessly exploring its features through the lens of the fully up-to-date statistics presented by this browser.<br><br>

Statistics Canada makes the LFS data available free, online, to anyone who wants to see them. So what is the need for this browser? The need arises, for me anyway, because Statistics Canada's online data tables contain only the basic statistics. While the institution provides a lot of its own analysis of these data, it offers no facility to help users manipulate and chart the data themselves. You can of course download one of the LFS tables and analyze the numbers on your own, using a spreadsheet or some other software, but this can be cumbersome and time-consuming.<br><br>

This browser allows you to explore the LFS data easily, from a number of different angles. It works best if you have a moderately large computer screen, but it also works fine on my laptop. Heck, the app even works tolerably well on my iPhone. It easily transforms the basic data by calculating percentage changes and other analytical manipulations. It also helps visualize changes in the statistics through time, by means of graphical representations.<br><br>

Statistics Canada provides the monthly LFS results in online tables. This browser presently deals with the main aggregate LFS dataset which has five dimensions: (i) labour force characteristics, (ii) geographical region (province), (iii) population sex group, (iv) population age group and (v) time in months. Every table and chart displayed by this program contains a footnote reference to the corresponding Statistics Canada online data table from which it is derived.<br><br>

You are presently reading from the 'Introduction and explanation' tab. There are presently two other tabs labelled 'Monthly tables' and 'Monthly charts'. You click them to gain access to their functions. It is straightforward to use these tabs. However, an explanation follows.<br>

<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>The 'Monthly tables' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> The 'Monthly tables' tab presents the statistics in tabular form. Many alternative tables can be viewed. You select one of them by choosing a unique combination of geography, sex group, age group and data transformation using the radio buttons at the top of the screen. The available transformations of the data are:<br><br>
- Original table (no transformation),<br>
- Indexed, starting month = 100,<br>
- One-month percentage change,<br>
- Twelve-month percentage change<br><br>
The time range to be displayed is also selectable, using a slider. It is possible to display a very wide table, stretching from January 1976 to date for example, which would scroll across the screen, or a narrow table displaying just a few months. You can also choose a 'window' of arbitrary length and move that window to different locations by clicking and dragging in the middle of the window.<br><br>

Note that for some geography/sex/age-group combinations there are no data avilable. This is because the LFS sample size does not permit reliable estimates to be calculated for those combinations. This is true for some of the most narrow age groups at the provincial level. Note also that when percentage changes are shown in a table the unemployment rate, participation rate and employment rate series are suppressed.<br><br>

There is a button on the right, above the display of a table, that can be used to download the table. The downloaded '.csv' file contains the data you see on the screen, covering the time range displayed, and if you choose one of the transformations, the downloaded data will have that transformation.<br>

<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:40px ; "><strong>The 'Monthly charts' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:40px ; "> The 'Monthly charts' tab allows you to draw a chart for any one of the time series that is available. The time range to be displayed in the chart is selectable, as is the choice of transformation.<br><br>

You begin making a chart by clicking in the 'Choose a time series' box to select a series to be plotted. There are nine options:<br><br>
- Labour force population<br>
- Labour force<br>
- Employment<br>
- Full-time employment<br>
- Part-time employment<br>
- Unemployment<br>
- Unemployment rate<br>
- Participation rate<br>
- Employment rate<br><br>
Then you use the radio buttons, as just described for the 'Monthly tables' tab, to select a geography, a sex group, an age group and a transformation. In addition, there is a button on the right, above the graphical display, that can be used to download the chart that is on the screen, as a '.png' file.<br><br>

There is also a box allowing you to specify, at your option, a different title for a chart. This option is provided because the default chart title is the Statistics Canada line caption for the chosen line in the table. Sometimes you might want a different title if you intend to download the chart. For example, instead of the Statistics Canada title "Employment" you might wish to substitute "Employment jumps again as the economy continues to boom!"<br>
