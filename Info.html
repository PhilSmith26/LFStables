<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:25px ; "><strong>Canadian Labour Force Survey Browser</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:25px ; "> This is a Canadian labour force survey browser. It presents the main results of Statistics Canada's labour force survey (LFS), in both tabular and graphical format. The survey gives a remarkably rich and timely picture of the Canadian labour market from 1976 to date. If you are interested in this topic, you could easily spend hours effortlessly exploring its features through the lens of the fully up-to-date statistics presented by this browser.<br><br>

Statistics Canada makes the LFS data available free, online, to anyone who wants to see them. So what is the need for this browser? The need arises (for me anyway) because Statistics Canada's online data tables contain only the basic statistics. While the institution provides a lot of its own excellent analysis of these data, it offers no facility to help users manipulate and chart the data themselves. You can of course download one of the LFS tables and analyze the numbers on your own, using a spreadsheet or some other software, but this can be cumbersome and time-consuming.<br><br>

This browser allows you to explore the LFS data easily, from a number of angles. It works best if you have a moderately large computer screen, but it also works fine on my laptop. The app even works tolerably on an iPhone. It easily transforms the basic data by calculating percentage changes and other analytical manipulations. It also helps visualize changes in the statistics through time, by means of graphical representations.<br><br>

Statistics Canada provides the monthly LFS results in online tables. (It also makes microdata available in Public Use Microdata Files.) This browser presents the main aggregate LFS dataset in many dimensions. The survey provides data on the labour force, employment and unemployment by geographical region (province), by population sex category, by population age group, by industry of attachment and hours worked as classified by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), by occupation as classified by the National Occupational Classification (NOC), by wage category and yet other facets of the labour market, all on a monthly basis.<br><br> 

Every table and chart displayed by this program contains a footnote reference to the corresponding Statistics Canada online data table from which it is derived.<br><br>

You are presently reading from the 'Introduction and explanation' tab. There are several other tabs labelled<br><br>
<ol><li>'Labour force characteristics by demography'</li> 
<li>'Labour force characteristics by industry'</li>
<li>'Labour force characteristics by occupation'</li> 
<li>'Hours worked by province and industry'</li> 
<li>'Actual hours worked at main job by industry'</li> 
<li>'Employee wage by industry'</li> 
<li>'Hourly wage distributions by occupation'</li> 
<li>'Average usual hours and wages by selected characteristics'</li> 
<li>'Job tenure by occupation'</li> 
<li>'Long-term LFS data'</li></ol><br> 
When you click one of them, you have a choice to view the data by means of tables or charts. It is straightforward to use these tabs.<br>

<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:25px ; "><strong>The 'Labour force characteristics by demography' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:25px ; "> The 'Labour force characteristics by demography' tab presents the statistics on labour force population, labour force, employment, unemployment, the unemployment rate, the participation rate and the employment rate for various geographical and demographic categories. Many alternative tables can be viewed. You select one by choosing a unique combination of geography, sex group, age group and data transformation using the buttons at the top of the screen. The available transformations of the data are:<br><br>
- Original table (no transformation),<br>
- Indexed, starting month = 100,<br>
- One-month percentage change,<br>
- Twelve-month percentage change<br><br>
The data are available from 1976 forward and the time range to be displayed is selectable, using a slider. It is possible to display a very wide table, stretching from January 1976 to date for example, which would scroll across the screen, or a narrow table displaying just a few months. You can also choose a 'window' of arbitrary length and move that window to different locations by clicking and dragging in the middle of the window.<br><br>

Note that for some geography/sex/age-group combinations there are no data available. This is because the LFS sample size does not permit reliable estimates to be calculated for those combinations. This is true for some of the most narrow age groups at the provincial level. Note also that when percentage changes are shown in a table the unemployment rate, participation rate and employment rate series are excluded.<br><br>

There is a button on the right, above the display of a table, that can be used to download the table. The downloaded '.csv' file contains the data you see on the screen, covering the time range displayed, and if you choose one of the transformations, the downloaded data will have that transformation.<br><br>

If you pick the chart option, you begin making a chart by clicking in the 'Choose a time series' box to select a series to be plotted. There are nine options:<br><br>
- Labour force population<br>
- Labour force<br>
- Employment<br>
- Full-time employment<br>
- Part-time employment<br>
- Unemployment<br>
- Unemployment rate<br>
- Participation rate<br>
- Employment rate<br><br>
You use the buttons to select a geography, a sex group, an age group and a transformation. In addition, there is a button on the right, above the graphical display, that can be used to download the chart that is on the screen, as a '.png' file.<br><br>

There is also a box allowing you to specify, at your option, a different title for a chart. This option is provided because the default chart title is the Statistics Canada line caption for the chosen line in the table. For one reason or another, if you want to download the chart you might prefer to specify a different title.<br>

<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:25px ; "><strong>The 'Labour force characteristics by industry' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:25px ; "> The 'Labour force characteristics by industry' tab presents a breakdown of the main labour force characteristics (labour force, employment, unemployment and unemployment rate) by industry, in tabular and graphical form. Their general operation is similar to that for the 'Labour force characteristics by demography' tab. Note that Statistics Canada makes these industry data available only from January 1987 forward.

<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:25px ; "><strong>The 'Labour force characteristics by occupation' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:25px ; "> The 'Labour force characteristics by occupation' tab presents a breakdown of the main labour force characteristics (labour force, employment, full-time employment, part-time employment, unemployment and unemployment rate) by occupational category, in tabular and graphical form. Note that Statistics Canada makes these occupational data available only from January 1987 forward and note that these data are not seasonally adjusted. These tables and charts are supported by a relatively large database and for this reason it takes a bit longer for a table or chart to load - about five seconds on my computer.

<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:25px ; "><strong>The 'Hours worked by province and industry' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:25px ; "> The 'Hours worked by province and industry' tab presents data on the hours worked in each two-digit industry within each province. These data have been seasonally adjusted by me for the purposes of this browser. Statistics Canada does not make these data available on a seasonally adjusted basis.

<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:25px ; "><strong>The 'Actual hours worked at main job by industry' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:25px ; "> The 'Actual hours worked at main job by industry' tab presents data on the hours worked in each two-digit industry. Note that Statistics Canada makes these industry data available only from January 1987 forward.

<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:25px ; "><strong>The 'Employee wage by industry' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:25px ; "> The 'Employee wage by industry' tab shows data on average and median hourly and weekly wages paid in each two-digit industry. Note that Statistics Canada makes these industry data available only from January 1997 forward and these data are not seasonally adjusted.

<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:25px ; "><strong>The 'Hourly wage distributions by occupation' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:25px ; "> The 'Hourly wage distributions by occupation' tab presents data on the range of wages paid in each two-digit industry. Note that Statistics Canada makes these industry data available only from January 1997 forward and these data are not seasonally adjusted.

<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:25px ; "><strong>The 'Average usual hours and wages by selected characteristics' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:25px ; "> The 'Average usual hours and wages by selected characteristics' tab presents data on the hours typically worked and wages paid by age group, sex, union/non-union coverage, permanent/temporary employment and occupation. Note that Statistics Canada makes these industry data available only from January 2001 forward and these data are not seasonally adjusted.

<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:25px ; "><strong>The 'Job tenure by occupation' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:25px ; "> The 'Job tenure by occupation' tab presents data on the number of months a person has tenure in a particular job with breakdowns by province, sex and occupation. Note that Statistics Canada makes these industry data available from January 1987 forward and these data are not seasonally adjusted. These tables and charts are supported by a relatively large database and for this reason it takes a bit longer for them to load - about seven seconds on my computer.

<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:25px ; "><strong>The 'Duration of unemployment' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:25px ; "> The 'Duration of unemployment' tab presents data on the number of persons unemployed for a range of different durations, measured in weeks. It also shows the average number weeks a person is unemployed and the percentages of the total unemployed that are jobless less than or more than 27 weeks.

<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:25px ; "><strong>The 'Long-term LFS data' tab</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:25px ; "> The 'Long-term LFS data' tab presents 100-year annual time series for the main LFS aggregates: population, labour force population, labour force, employment, unemployment, not in the labour force, participation rate, unemployment rate and employment rate. I have compiled these data myself from a variety of LFS and other Statistics Canada publications, linking them together as best I can. These statistics should be regarded with considerable caution because there are a number of time series breaks. There was no pre-war labour force survey as such and the survey that began after the war was restructured a number of times before 1976, the year in which the basic time series in the other tables originate.
