# LFStables

Statistics Canada releases results from its monthly labour force survey once a month. The survey collects information about the Canadian labour force population size, the labour force size, full-time employment, part-time employment and unemployment, plus other details about hours worked, wages paid, etc. This project aims to make it easier for analysts to study the results from this survey. It does this by allowing users to segment the LFS estimates by selecting from a number of options and then either displaying the corresponding table or plotting a chart for one of the time series in the table.

The options include: (i) geography (a province or all of Canada), (ii) sex (both sexes, males or females), (iii) age group (there are nine of them), (iv) NAICS industry, (v) NOC occupation, (vi) hours worked, (vii) wages, (viii) job tenure by occupation, (ix) duration of unemployment and (x) century-long annual time series. The app also allows the data to be transformed (percentage changes, indexing) and the monthly time range can be selected (January 1976 to date).
